# Distributed workflow

## Initial thoughts
In order to work on this project together as a team, it is important to setup rules for how you develop on the project in parallel, we decided to create a workflow using GitHub which is a online implementation of Git.

### Repo setup
Currently we are using 1 repoisitory to store all the different code bases.

### Branching model & How to contribute
When a developers is making changes to a codebase the developer creates a branch

We have decided on three types of branches:
/feature
/test
/refactor

We may add more if need be, the point of it being that your branch tag should be descriptive of the work you are doing.

### Current flow: 
Create a branch of the main branch, implement the feature/test/refactor, upon completion commit the code and create a pull request of the code to be pulled back into the main branch. If the pull request is accepted, the branch can be deleted, otherwise the developer goes  back and makes nessecary changes before making a new pull request.

### Responsibility & Distributed development workflow
Every team member is responsible for the project, but we are using Trello in order to delegate tasks and to know who is working on what functionality at any given time

### Reflection
While the above is our current rules for how we develop on the project, we realise that while learning about DevOps these processes may need to change in order to optimize and better the process. It is therefore important to constantly reflect and better the process through each project iteration.
